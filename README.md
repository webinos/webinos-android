## Build webinos-android from source

webinos-android is an Android application project with npm package management. Our recommended build environment is 32-bit Ubuntu 12.04 or higher. If you are using 64-bit Ubuntu, please run the following command:

    sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

Other Linux distributions, emulated Linux environments, or Unix-like systems are not fully tested but should work, maybe with some twistings. It is also possible for you to derive a build process based on instructions here for other platforms like Windows, Mac OS.


### Prerequisites

    * Node.js
    * node-gyp
    * Git
    * Ant
    * JDK
    * G++
    * libgnome-keyring-dev
    * libssl-dev
    * Android SDK


#### Install Node

We need Node v0.8.x (x>=14). 'apt-get install nodejs' might not give you a required Node version. If so please download a ~v0.8.14 version from here:

http://nodejs.org/dist/

Then do a global install manually.


#### Install node-gyp

    sudo npm install -g node-gyp


#### Install Git

    sudo apt-get install git


#### Install Ant

    sudo apt-get install ant


#### Install JDK

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk

    export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/Android/SDK


### Get webinos-android source code

You can get the source code from GitHub.

    git clone https://github.com/webinos/webinos-android


### Build webinos-android with Ant

To build a debug installer, execute

    cd webinos-android
    ant anode webinos-deps -Ddevice=<profile> clean debug

In the command,

* Target *anode* puts anode source under webinos-android/libs with its own Git.
* Target *webinos-deps* installs webinos dependencies into webinos-android/node_modules with npm.
* Property *device* is the device profile that includes defined webinos APIs. Current device profiles are defined in webinos-android/config_profiles.json. If the -D option is omitted, the default profile will be used.

If successful the target is generated as

bin/webinos-android-debug.apk


### Build webinos-android with ADT Eclipse

ADT Version 22.0.x is supported. We still need Ant to get the dependencies.

1. Import the project into Eclipse
  
  1) In the "File" menu, "New" -> "Project..." to open the "New Project" window.
  
  2) Expand "Android", select "Android Project from Existing Code", and click "Next>".
  
  3) Click "Browse..." button, in the pop-up window select your webinos-android folder, click "OK".
  
  4) In the "Import Projects" window, make sure in the "Project to Import" box only webinos-android is checked, then click "Finish".

2. Get project dependencies (can be skipped if you have already run command line Ant build)
  
  1) In the "Run" menu select "External tools" -> "External Tools Configurations...".
  
  2) In the "External Tools Configurations" window, expand "Ant Build", you will see the configuration named *configuration_ant*.
  
  3) Select the configuration. In the "Arguments:" box in the "Main" tab, replace *-Ddevice=default* with *-Ddevice=&lt;profile&gt;*, where *&lt;profile&gt;* is your selected device profile, click "Apply", and click "Run". In the "Console" View window you should see the webinos dependencies being built in.

3. Build and run
  
  1) To make sure the dependencies are included, right-click the wbinos-android project, in the pop-up menu click "Refresh".
  
  2) Build and run as Android application. If successful the installer is created as

  bin/webinos-android.apk


## Windows Notes

On windows, if you are using visual studio 2012, you will have to manually specify the visual studio version on node-gyp otherwise you will get an error:
"error MSB8020: The builds tools for Visual Studio 2010 (Platform Toolset = 'v100') cannot be found".
In order to get pass this error, modify the custom_rules.xml file and add the "--msvs_version=2012" argument in the npm command (line 30) by adding the following line:

    <arg line="--msvs_version=2012"/>
